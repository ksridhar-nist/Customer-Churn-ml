# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction

This project predicts whether a customer will leave (churn) or stay, using the **Telco Customer Churn Dataset**.  
It applies **data preprocessing, feature selection, handling class imbalance (SMOTE)**, and machine learning models to make predictions.  
Model interpretability is also done using **SHAP**.
